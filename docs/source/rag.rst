Passing into LLMs
========================

Since processing tables takes a nontrivial amount of time, I recommend **converting all pdf documents into text files**
long before embedding them and passing them into LLMs.

Any text format can be used, but for the best performance, I recommend markdown or latex. 
For your convenience, an experimental method automatically
converts a pdf document into a format suitable for LLMs. The method `embed_tables` produces the pdf content interspersed with tables in markdown-like format.

Note that the presence of line breaks depends on a heuristic which works best with PyMuPDF. 
While line breaks have been ported to PyPDFium2Document, the approximation is imperfect. 
See the :ref:`mupdf` section for more information.

.. code-block:: python
    
    from gmft._rich_text.rich_page import embed_tables

    doc = PyMuPDFDocument("test/samples/7.pdf") # PyMuPDF is preferred
    
    # PyPdfium2 is possible, but line breaks may be less accurate
    # doc = PyPDFium2Document("path/to/pdf")
    
    rich_pages = embed_tables(doc=doc, tables=pdf7_tables)
    
    assert rich_pages[3].get_text().startswith("""Infectious of Alestig al. BMC Diseases Page 2011, 11:124 4 7 et

Which format is best?
----------------------

For the simple task of matching a cell to its header, performance is (best to worst): 

    markdown ~ latex ~ json > html >> csv_plus* >> csv ~ tsv

(Only OpenAI models were tested. csv_plus is csv, but with an extra space after each comma. The improvement in performance might be attributable to better tokenization.)
